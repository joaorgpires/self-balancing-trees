# Self Balancing Trees

In this work, we implement two types of Self Balancing Trees: AVL and Red-Black trees.

## Background

Some background on AVL and Red-Black Trees can be read after compiling [this](report/taa_report.tex) TeX file.

## Compiling and executing the implementation

This code compiles both in **MacOS** and **Linux** systems, using *clang* and *g++*, respectively. To do that, navigating throught the right folder in **src** folder, just run `make all`. To execute, simply run `./main`. To clean all executables and intermediary files, run `make clean`.
